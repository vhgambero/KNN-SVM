# KNN-SVM - Study Repository
This repository is dedicated to my studies and exploration of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), two popular algorithms in the field of machine learning. The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive collection of experiments, implementations, and insights gained during my learning process.

## Purpose
The primary objectives of this repository include:

### Educational Resource:
To serve as a study guide for understanding KNN and SVM, including their underlying principles, use cases, and differences.

### Implementation Examples:
To document various implementations of KNN and SVM using different datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of each algorithm in classification tasks.

### Parameter Tuning:
To explore and analyze the impact of different parameters, such as the number of neighbors in KNN and the choice of kernel in SVM, on model performance.
Key Features

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

Detailed implementation examples demonstrating how to use KNN for classification tasks.
Experiments with different values of k to assess how the choice of neighbors affects accuracy and performance.
Support Vector Machines (SVM):

Comprehensive examples of SVM implementations, including linear and non-linear kernel methods.
Discussions on hyperparameter tuning, including the choice of kernel functions and regularization parameters.
Model Evaluation:

Documentation of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score used to assess the performance of both KNN and SVM models.
Comparative analysis to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm based on various datasets.

## Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for implementing KNN and SVM models.
Scikit-learn: Utilized for building and evaluating KNN and SVM classifiers.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and analysis.
## Future Developments
As I continue my studies, I plan to expand this repository with more advanced techniques, including ensemble methods that combine KNN and SVM with other algorithms, as well as applying these models to real-world problems to gain practical insights.
